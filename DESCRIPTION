Description: Extracts bulk climate data from the 
    Environment Canada website for one or more 
    weather stations available from Environment Canada. 
    Additionally, you can generate a list of URLs for 
    weather stations. Currently, the tool available on the 
    Environment Canada website <https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html)>
    only allows you to manually pull data from a single
    weather station at a time, which can be cumbersome and
    is not ideal for use in an automated pipeline.
